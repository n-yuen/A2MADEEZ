# A2MADEEZ

My first programming projects were on the TI-84. This is a do-it-all program for algebra 2 students designed to solve most of the problems they see.

The program was originally created by 2 Head-Royce students but I overhauled and optimized the program and also fixed bugs and added many new features.

The program is still a work in progress and I am aware of a few bugs, particularly in the Amortize and Quadratic sections.

For best experience, view using the TI-Connect app.

# Features

Too many to list. Quadratic equation solver with smart fraction/radical view. Exponential growth solver. Amortization solver. Sequences solver. Trig helper.
